        <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer Malan. I live in the beautiful state of Idaho and I'm attending BYUI through pathways.
            I've finished a certificate in Social Media Marketing and a certificate in Graphic Design Fundamentals.
            Now I'm working on a certificate for Web & Computer Programming. I'm married and I have 4 kids who keep
            me busy. In my spare time, I like to read, play board games, and crochet.

        <p>I live in the beautiful state of Idaho! There are lots of things to see and do here. We are bordered by
            Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and just a bit of Canada on the northern tip of the
            panhandle! </p>
